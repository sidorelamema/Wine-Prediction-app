# Wine Prediction Model using Spark on AWS EMR
Problem Statement: Develop a wine quality prediction machine learning model using Spark on AWS Elastic MapReduce (EMR). The project involves:
1. Training the model in parallel on multiple EC2 instances
2. Deploying it to predict wine quality in an application running on a single EC2 instance.
3. Build a Docker container for the prediction application.
